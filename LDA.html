        <h2>Exploratory Analysis and Tokenization</h2>
        <p>Exploratory analysis and Tokenization was performed. The textual data was prepared to serve as an input for the training of the LDA model.The stop words were removed and the tokenized objects were converted into a corpus and a dictionary.</p>

        <h2>Representation of an LDA Model</h2>
        <p>A document-term matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.

        <h2>LDA Model Training</h2>
        <p>All the parameters were kept to default except for inputting the number of topics.We built a model with 10 topics where each topic was a combination of keywords, and each keyword contributed a certain weightage to the topic.</p>

        <p>Graphical representation of the LDA model, each node represents random variables, the edges possible dependence between them and the plates denote replicated structure. In reality the LDA model only observe the words (shaded w random variable) of each document.  </p>
