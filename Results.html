        <h2>Bigram</h2>
        <p>Bigrams are a framework in which both existing process calculi and new models of behaviour can be formulated, yielding theory that is shared among these models. A short survey of the main features of bigraphs is presented, showing how they can be developed from standard graph theory using elementary category theory.</p>

        <h2>Trigram</h2>
        <p>
          Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete dataset such as text corpora. It is also a topic model that is used for discovering abstract topics from a collection of documents.
          In the text analysis, it is often a good practice to filter out some stop words, which are the most common words.

        <h2>Word Cloud</h2>
        <p>A word cloud (also known as a tag cloud) is a visual representation of words. Cloud creators are used to highlight popular words and phrases based on frequency and relevance. They provide you with quick and simple visual insights that can lead to more in-depth analyses.</p>

              <h2>Single-gram</h2>
        <p>All possible Singlegrams are extracted from a text and are represented as nodes. The characters of an N-gram may originate from one word or consequent words even including the space character that separates them. For example, in sentiment analysis applications the N-grams are case sensitive because capital or smaller letters may be used to express the emotions of the writer. </p>
